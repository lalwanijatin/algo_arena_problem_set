## Problem: Second Maximum

### Problem Statement:
Given a list of integers, your task is to write an algorithm that finds and returns the **second maximum** element in the list.

### Input:
- A list of integers, where the size of the list is always greater than 1.
- All elements in the list may be distinct or contain duplicates.

### Output:
- Return the **second maximum** integer from the list.

### Constraints:
- The size of the list, `n`, will always be greater than 1: `n > 1`.
- The elements in the list are not necessarily distinct.

### Example:
#### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element is 9, and the second largest is 5.

#### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]
Output: 30
Explanation: The largest element is 40, and the second largest is 30.
